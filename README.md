Reserving online, recieving the airplane ticket and online payment using visa/mastercard.


## Available Scripts

### `npm i`

Installs all the packages used in the project.<br>

### `nodemon app.js`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
`nodemon` is used in place of `node` for easier development.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. <br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
